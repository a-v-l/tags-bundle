## Role of the managers

The tag managers are responsible for  

Currently available managers:

1. **Default manager**

The default tags manager stores the tags in the `tl_cfg_tag` table and uses Contao models with accompaniment 
of [codefog/contao-haste](https://github.com/codefog/contao-haste) behind the scenes.

## Creating managers

In order to provide your own tags manager you have to implement the `Codefog\TagsBundle\Manager\ManagerInterface` interface.
A good example is the default manager which can be found in `Codefog\TagsBundle\Manager\DefaultManager`.

### DCA field update

If you would like to handle every DCA field that uses your manager, make sure that your class implements the
`Codefog\TagsBundle\Manager\DcaAwareInterface` interface. Once that's done the built-in event listener
will trigger the interface methods each time the data container is loaded. 

### Insert tags

To make your manager support the insert tags replacement, make sure to implement the 
`Codefog\TagsBundle\Manager\InsertTagsAwareInterface` interface. The interface methods will be called whenever
the insert tag referencing your manager is to be replaced, e.g. `{{tag::my_manager::tag_value::name}}`.
